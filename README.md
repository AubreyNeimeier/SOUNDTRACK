README
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the application up and running.

Application Description
Do you ever feel intese nostalgia when hearing a song? When the music that’s playing brings your right back to a certain memory, city, or time in your life? SoundTrack is a journal platform, that will eventually leverage Spotify’s API so that music and memories can interwine like they do in real life.

For now, simply create a user login, and create temporary 'morning pages' that will disapear and declutter your mind upon a broswer refresh and more permanetely record your journal entries. 

In order to get my application up and running
Using the terminal from the project's parent directory, enter the following commands:

rake start

In your local browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000

Create an account 

write your morning pages to declutter your mind

write your journal entry after you've cleared your mind
